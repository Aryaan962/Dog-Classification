# Dog Classification
A more complex convolutional neural network model that is able to predict a species of dog from an image. I created a super primitive app(really a function) which detects if the image is a person, dog, or something else and prints a phrase accordingly.

Then it runs the image through a model if it is a person to predict the closest dog species resmblence. But if the model detects a dog, then it returns the closest dog species resemblence with the input image. The performance of the classification model is over 70%.

Try it out by importing the code into your own jupyter notebook and tryout the classifier yourself!
